# *Prepare For Trouble, and Make It Double!*

### My experience web developing on two different platforms 

  When I began this project, it seemed easy enough. Put information about myself, including my resume and projects, on two different web developing sites. I foolishly thought to myself “that should be fun!”. Only a day or two into completing the project and I discovered that the process was not, in fact, fun. While I had no trouble coming up with the content I wanted to show on my sites, I struggled immensely with putting everything together.<br>

  On my first go at creating my GitHub site, I put together a few pages, went to check out how the end result was looking, and discovered that my personal page was nowhere to be found by the internet. I struggled with finding the issue because I am just a beginner at coding and programming and my eyes are not yet trained to figure out the cause of issues. I ended up scrapping the whole website and starting over, where I encountered the same issue. I ended up having to reach out to my professor, Dr. B, who is a more seasoned coder than me. With her help I finally identified the root of my problems. For a beginner, I would absolutely say that troubleshooting will be the hardest thing to do when starting out, and it is extremely helpful to have someone on standby who knows more about it than you do.<br>

  I had a much easier time with WordPress. It is definitely the more beginner friendly site to use when developing a personal page. The only thing I would say I was a bit annoyed with was that with the design I picked for my site, I couldn’t chose to put my menu at the top without creating a menu widget, which I didn’t want to mess around with. This site was also easier to link sites together. In GitHub I ended up putting hyperlinks to each page on every separate page of the site. There is a way that you can create a menu, but that takes more skill than I currently have.<br>

One of the skills I would say is most helpful to have is to know how to make specific searches for the problems you’re having. In most instances when I was stuck, a quick google search could usually put me back on track. To improve my sites, I would definitely want to be a little more skilled at being able to read and interpret other’s code snippets and be able to incorporate their ideas into my own site. As of right now, it’s tough for me to understand how I can use code written by others to my advantage.<br>

  Overall, I thought that this project helped me learn more about how to troubleshoot and use tips from others to better understand how to code and design. Moving forward I believe that this will be a big help in future projects and a good skill to develop and add to my resume. I think that I will keep my sites up and continue to edit them as I learn more so that I can use them professionally.<br>
