My name is Natalya Myers, and I am a DIGIT major at Penn State Behrend in my sophomore year. I enjoy reading, creating, and am an active member in Behrend’s theater.

This is my personal page, where you can find information on me, view my resume, and keep up to date on projects I am currently working on or have finished.
