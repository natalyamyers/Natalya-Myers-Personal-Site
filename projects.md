## My Projects and What’s In the Works
My most recent project was a short film for my Art168 course. We explored cinematic languages, how to make a film tell a story, and how to edit in Adobe Premiere Pro. I decided to make my short film about my cat, Birdie, and what a day in her perspective is like. You can watch the film [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5GCT7CL9YY)!

I’m currently working on a second project in Art168 with photoshop and creating artistic pictures from a simple landscape portrait. Nothing to show yet, but I will update when it’s finished!

You’re viewing one of my projects right now just by being on this site! For my Digit100 course we’re exploring web development on two different platforms, WordPress and Github Pages. Right now you’re viewing my GitHub site, click [here](sites.psu.edu/natalyamyerspersonal/) to go over to my WordPress Page and compare! And click [here](finalthoughts.md) to read my thoughts on the project.
